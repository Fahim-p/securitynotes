# Task 2 - Threat Modeling Overview

- Threat modeling
	- Systematic approach to identifying, prioritizing, and addressing potential security issues
	- Develops proactive security measures and make informed decisions about resource allocation
	- Reduces risk exposure by identifying vulnerabilities and attack vectors

| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Threat**        | Refers to any potential occurrence, event, or actor that may exploit vulnerabilities to compromise information confidentiality, integrity, or availability.                  |
| **Vulnerability** | A weakness or flaw in a system, application, or process that may be exploited by a threat to cause harm. It may arise from software bugs, misconfiguration, or design flaws. |
| **Risk**          | The possibility of being compromised because of a threat taking advantage of a vulnerability. How likely an attack might be successful and how much damage it could cause.   |

| **Damage**          | Data loss, system downtime, or reputational damage.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Reproducibility** | The ease with which an attacker can successfully recreate the exploitation of a vulnerability.                                                                                                                                              |
| **Exploitability**  | The difficulty level involved in exploiting the vulnerability considering factors such as technical skills required, availability of tools or exploits.<br>Amount of time it would take to exploit the vulnerability successfully.          |
| **Affected Users**  | The number or portion of users impacted once the vulnerability has been exploited.                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Discoverability** | The ease with which an attacker can find and identify the vulnerability considering whether it is publicly known or how difficult it is to discover based on the exposure of the assets (publicly reachable or in a regulated environment). |

- Opinion-based model that heavily relies on an analyst's interpretation and assessment. 
- However, the reliability of this framework can still be improved by following some **guidelines**:
	- Establish a standardized set of guidelines and definitions for each DREAD category that provides a consistent understanding of how to rate vulnerabilities. 
		- Can be supported by providing examples and scenarios to illustrate how scores should be assigned under various circumstances.
	- Encourage collaboration and discussion among multiple teams. 
		- Constructive feedback from different members aids in justifying the assigned scores, which can lead to a more accurate assessment.
	- Use the DREAD framework with other risk-assessment methodologies and regularly review and update the chosen methods and techniques
		- Ensure they remain relevant and aligned with the organization's needs.
- **Qualitative Analysis using DREAD**
	- Rating each category from one to ten based on a subjective assessment and interpretation of the questions above. 
	- Average score of all criteria will calculate the overall DREAD risk rating.

| **MITREÂ ATT&CK** | UnlikeÂ DREADÂ andÂ STRIDE, which focus more on potential risks and vulnerabilities, ATT&CK provides a practical and hands-on approach by mapping adversary tactics. Assess the effectiveness of existing controls against known attack techniques used by threat actors.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **DREAD**        | DREADÂ offers a more numerical and calculated approach to threat analysis thanÂ STRIDEÂ orÂ MITREÂ ATT&CK, making it excellent for clearly prioritising threats. Qualitatively assess the potential risks associated with specific threats. Prioritise risk mitigation based on the collective score produced by eachÂ DREADÂ component.                                                                                                                               |
| **STRIDE**       | While other frameworks likeÂ MITREÂ ATT&CK focus on real-world adversary tactics,Â STRIDEÂ shines in its structure and methodology, allowing for a systematic review of threats specific to software systems. Analyse and categorise threats in software systems.<br>- Identify potential vulnerabilities in system components based on the sixÂ STRIDEÂ threat categories. Implement appropriate security controls to mitigate specific threat types.                |
| **PASTA**        | Excellent for aligning threat modelling with business objectives. Unlike other frameworks,Â PASTAÂ integrates business context, making it a more holistic and adaptable choice for organisations. Conduct risk-centric threat modelling exercises aligned with business objectives. Prioritise threats based on their potential impact and risk level to the organisation. Build a flexible methodology that can be adapted to different organisational contexts. |
