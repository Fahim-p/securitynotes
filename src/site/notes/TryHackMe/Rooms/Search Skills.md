# Task 3 - Search Engines

- **"exact phrase"**
	- Double quotes indicate that you are looking for pages with the exact word or phrase.
	- For example, one might search for "passive reconnaissance" to get pages with this exact phrase.
- **site::**
	- This operator lets you specify the domain name to which you want to limit your search.
	- For example, we can search for success stories on TryHackMe using site:tryhackme.com success stories.
- **-:**
	- The minus sign allows you to omit search results that contain a particular word or phrase.
	- For example, you might be interested in learning about the pyramids, but you don’t want to view tourism websites; one approach is to search for pyramids -tourism or -tourism pyramids.
- **filetype::**
	- This search operator is indispensable for finding files instead of web pages.
	- Some of the file types are PDF, DOCX, XLS, and PPT.
	- For example, to find cyber security presentations, try searching for filetype:ppt cyber security.
