# Task 2 - What is PowerShell

- Cross-platform task automation solution and configuration management tool in command-line shell
- Object-oriented, based on .NET framework
- Cme.exe and batch files couldn't do much in automation and management of systems
- **Object**
	- Represents an item with properties and methods
	- Can contain file names, usernames, or sizes as data (properties) and carry functions (methods) such as copying
- **Cmdlet**
	- Returns objects that retain their properties and methods
- More powerful and flexible data manipulation since they donâ€™t need additional parsing of text

> [!Question] 
**What do we call the advanced approach used to develop PowerShell?**

> [!Done] Answer
Object-Oriented
