# Task 3 - Vulnerability Classification

- Based on the **SCAP** (Security Content Automation Protocol) standard by NIST, primary components are,
	- **CVE** (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
		- Identifies vulnerabilities that can be exploited to launch an attack
		- Comes with unique ID, description, and at least one public reference
	- **CCE** (Common Configuration Enumeration)
		- Gives system configuration issues unique identifiers to quickly and accurately link configuration data from different information sources and tools 
		- Used to match up configuration assessment tool results with recommended best practices. 
	- **CPE** (Common Platform Enumeration) 
		-  Method for classifying and identifying devices, operating systems (OS), and application types inside an infrastructure
	- **CVSS** (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)
		-  Scoring system that rates the severity of vulnerabilities and identifies their characteristics

# Task 4 - Vulnerability Management Life Cycle - Discover and Prioritize

6 phases in vulnerability management lifecycle from NIST cybersecurity framework; Discover, prioritize, assess, report, remediate, verify

![|300](/img/user/TryHackMe/THM_Images/Pasted image 20250210234737.png)
## Step 1: Discover

Went to website http://10.10.208.202:9392, and logged in with admin : admin 

![1000](/img/user/TryHackMe/THM_Images/Pasted image 20250210235314.png)

Can perform organization-wide scan to get any potential threats to organizations information and critical threats. Went to "Configuration" and then "Targets"

![1000](/img/user/TryHackMe/THM_Images/Pasted image 20250210235450.png)

![1000](/img/user/TryHackMe/THM_Images/Pasted image 20250210235516.png)

Got information from the room about the IP address of the windows host

![](/img/user/TryHackMe/THM_Images/Pasted image 20250210235550.png)

Then went to "Scans" and then "Tasks" to add a scan task with our newly created target, "Windows"

![1000](/img/user/TryHackMe/THM_Images/Pasted image 20250210235814.png)

![1000](/img/user/TryHackMe/THM_Images/Pasted image 20250210235956.png)

![](/img/user/TryHackMe/THM_Images/Pasted image 20250211000035.png)

Once done, we can run the task in order to start the scan and get the results. In this case, it was already done in the machine.

![1000](/img/user/TryHackMe/THM_Images/Pasted image 20250211000157.png)

We can click on the eye icon and check the results tab to see the scan results.

## Step 2 - Prioritize

- Group and assign risk-based priorities to assets
- Aids in decision making process for resource distribution
- Prioritize found vulnerabilities in assets based on operational importance
	- Any data breaches or DB access are classified as top priority.

> [!Task] 
> We have already scanned an Ubuntu machine; therefore, answer the following questions based on the scan report of LinuxAppTask task.

![1000](/img/user/TryHackMe/THM_Images/Pasted image 20250211001020.png)

![1000](/img/user/TryHackMe/THM_Images/Pasted image 20250211001037.png)

> [!Question] 
> **After scanning, what is the total number of medium-level vulnerabilities?**

Based of screenshot above

> [!done] Answer
> 1

> [!Question] 
> **What is the severity score for the vulnerability "`ICMP Timestamp Reply Information Disclosure`"?**

Based of screenshot above

> [!done] Answer
> 2.1

> [!Question] 
> **What is the operating system and the version number of the target machine?**

> [!done] Answer
> Ubuntu 20.04

# Task 5 - Vulnerability Management Life Cycle - Assess & Report

## Step 3: Assess

- Create risk baseline through determine how severe each asset is
- Decide which risks to eliminate on factors like classification, criticality level, or vulnerability level

## Step 4: Reporting

- Can get reports straight from the vulnerability scanner
	- Can come with remedial measures to fix issues found
- Confirm false positives before adding to report, 
	- Flag it in the tool report for future reference

> [!Question] 
> **Download the LinuxAppTask report in PDF format. What is the severity rating of the vulnerability in the report, where the solution type is "Workaround"?**

Downloaded the PDF report

![](/img/user/TryHackMe/THM_Images/Pasted image 20250211002257.png)

Searched for the word "workaround" within the report.

> [!Question] 
> **What is the solution type for the `TCP timestamps` vulnerability?**

Searched for the word "TCP Timestamps" within the same report.

# Task 6 - Vulnerability Management Life Cycle - Remediate & Verify

## Step 5: Remediation

- Fixing the problem, starting with most severe
- Can either mitigate the problem or perform remedial action to completely remove it
- Can acknowledge vulnerability if they choose to do nothing

> [!Task] 
> **Create a ticket for resolving the "Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information via HTTP" vulnerability.**

# Task 7 - Vulnerability Management Framework

- Widely adopted framework called Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) by NIST
	- Good risk management resources for business and governments
	- 5 areas
		- Identify
		- Protect
		- Detect
		- Respond
		- Recover
