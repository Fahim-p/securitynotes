# Task 2 - Vulnerability Scanning

- Compliance requirement for regulatory bodies
- Quarterly or once a year

| Authenticated Scans                                                                                          | Unauthenticated Scans                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Credentials of the subject host must be provided to the vulnerability scanner.                               | Vulnerability scanner only needs the IP address.                                                |
| Identifies vulnerabilities for attackers that have access to the host.                                       | Identifies vulnerabilities for external attackers that have no access  <br>to the subject host. |
| Provides a deeper visibility into the target system by scanning its configuration and installed applications | It is less resource-intensive and straightforward to set up.                                    |
| For example, scanning an internal database by providing its credentials to the vulnerability scanner.        | For example, scanning a public facing website for vulnerabilities that any user can exploit.    |

|Internal Scans|External Scans|
|---|---|
|Vulnerabilities that can be exploited inside the network.|Vulnerabilities that can be exploited from outside the network.|
|Identifies vulnerabilities that would be exposed to the attackers once they get inside the network.|Identifies the vulnerabilities exposed to the attacker from outside the network.|

# Task 3 - Tools for Vulnerability Scanning

- **Nessus**
	- Free and paid options
	- Used by large enterprises
	- Needs to be deployed and managed on-prem
	![image.png | 1000](/img/user/TryHackMe/THM_Images/82c784b992a69e594e18da6e4530ea38.png)
- **Qualys**
	- Subscription-based, cloud-based platform
	- Also provides compliance checks and asset management
![image 1.png | 1000](/img/user/TryHackMe/THM_Images/78b30bcfe9d37df065f94c426e7115ae.png)
    
- **Nexpose**
	- Subscription-based
	- Continuously discovers new assets and performs vuln scans on them
	- Gives vuln risk scores based on asset value and vuln impact
	- Compliance check against various standards
	- Both on-prem and hybrid (cloud and on-prem) deployment modes
![image 2.png | 1000](/img/user/TryHackMe/THM_Images/28b24704b31c4b1e803c8907d12e3ffe.png)
- **OpenVAS**
	- Open-source, scans vulns through database
	- Not as powerful as commercial tools
	- Good for small orgs and individual systems
![image 3.png | 1000](/img/user/TryHackMe/THM_Images/a42edccec7ca1a6cc046443575ab0bf2.png)
- All of them give detailed vuln scan reports
	- Vuln discovered, risk scores, detailed descriptions
	- Some can offer remediation methods for discovered vulns
	- Can export the reports in different formats
# Task 4 - CVE & CVSS

- **CVE**
	- Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
	- Unique number given to vulnerabilities
	- New vulnerabilities are given unique CVE and uploaded in CVE database, published to the public
	- Developed by MITRE corporation
	- CVE-2024-9374
		- CVE prefix: Every CVE number has the prefix “CVE” in the beginning.
		- Year: Year it was discovered (e.g., 2024).
		- Arbitrary Digits: Four or more arbitrary digits (e.g., 9374)
- **CVS**
	- Common Vulnerability Scoring System
	- CVSS score
		- Determines severity of the CVE
	- Multiple factors such as impact, ease of exploitability, etc.

| CVSS Score Range | Severity Levels |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| 0.0-3.9          | Low             |
| 4.0-6.9          | Medium          |
| 7.0-8.9          | High            |
| 9.0-10           | Critical        |

# Task 5 - OpenVAS

Can use docker to install OpenVAS, many dependencies

```
sudo docker run -d -p 443:443 --name openvas mikesplain/openvas
```

![image 4.png](/img/user/TryHackMe/THM_Images/cfed4414a585816cfdba6ec569908a62.png)

Access web interface by putting in [https://127.0.0.1](https://127.0.0.1/)

Enter login credentials, dashboard will open with overview of all scans

# Task 6 - Practical Exercise

- Scenario:
	- A reputable firm conducted a vulnerability scan on a server (10.10.102.46) on its network that stores critical information.
	- Conducted the activity using the OpenVAS vulnerability scanner, and the vulnerability scan report was placed on the desktop.
	- You are an information security engineer working for that firm.
	- You are tasked with reviewing this report.
